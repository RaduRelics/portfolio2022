A lot of people know that I love to use FOSS (free and open-source software).
But while I try to answer as many questions about which software replacement others should choose, I cannot possibly cover every piece of software.

This article simply contains the software I use and recommend; Most of it requires little to no elite® knowledge of GNU/Linux or software in general; *which doesn't mean learning is bad.*

# Operating Systems
**I prefer to run UNIX-like operating systems.**
Of course for the most part I run GNU/Linux systems; Operating systems based off the GNU core utilities and the Linux kernel that some people call "Linux distros" for brevity. My Linux distro of choice is [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/), mostly because it offers a fast package manager with a large-enough pool of updated software, all the configuration and software is kept as simple as possible making maintenance a breeze, and the Arch User Repository offers an excellent way to installs packages outside of the relatively small vanilla repos. ***The AUR makes Arch (probably) the single distro with most software available for it.***

**However this doesn't mean Arch Linux is flawless...**

# (Other) Operating Systems
I think many more advanced Linux users wish to compile more software, for example their [kernel](https://kernel.org/), from source. Compiling your software from source offers a lot of performance advantages, and for this a distribution like [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/) or [KISS Linux](https://k1ss.org/) is what I'd recommend. Some may prefer a completely different approach to package management and system configuration though, for that I'd recommend something like [NixOS](https://nixos.org/). It allows you to roll back to previous package versions, makes it extremely easy to share your configuration with others and allows you to install multiple versions of the same package.

There is also the issue of [systemd](https://systemd.io/), the init system of choice for Arch Linux. Systemd does not follow the UNIX philosophy of being a small, simple, one-purpose program that's easy to understand; Just like the Linux kernel, it is large and ever-growing, and mostly monolithic. I choose to use systemd and Arch Linux merely out of necessity and convenience; A distribution such as Artix, Arch Linux without systemd, may ship more broken or incomplete packages. There are also some packages I use that rely on systemd. If you are willing to live with these slight flaws, then [Artix](https://artixlinux.org/), [Devuan](https://www.devuan.org/) or [Void](https://voidlinux.org/) is for you.

For some people that just isn't enough, they just want to get the GNU out of Linux, for that [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/) works wonders, being based on musl and Busybox instead of GNU Coreutils and is using OpenRC as its init system, it’s perfect for those who prefer a lightweight and secure operating system.

If you wish to wonder outside the boundaries of Linux, you can give BSD a shot. What I’d recommend is [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/). BSD is similar to Linux, in the sense that it is still a UNIX-like operating system, but it has a completely different philosophy when it comes to how certain things should work, I might go in detail in a future article.

# Shell
I normally have multiple shells installed on my system at once; **[Fish](https://fishshell.com/) and [ZSH](https://www.zsh.org/) or Bash.** I have Fish set to my user shell due to its convenient auto-complete and memory functions along with its wonderful color-scheme compared to boring 'ol Bash. *However,* sometimes I use ZSH with [OhMyZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/) mostly for the same reasons as Fish, but I still keep Bash in case anything breaks or if I occasionally want to run more complex one-liner commands. 

# Text Editing
My choice of text editor is often [vim](https://www.vim.org/) or a fork of it: [neovim](https://neovim.io/); it offers a lot of complex and powerful functionality while also being usable by anyone who can open and type in a terminal. However, while I mostly use neovim to write I understand why people may wish to use a more "user friendly" option such as a graphical text editor. **For those who prefer graphical text editors I recommend [gedit](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit), but if you still prefer something terminal-based you can always use [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) as it may be easier to get used to than vim.** *I have also started using [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) for text editing, [DOOM emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) to be precise, while I love it, I cannot give a fair comparison to other text editors as I haven’t used it as much.*

# Window Management/"DE"
I personally prefer using the [Openbox](https://openbox.org/) floating window manager or some tiling window manager such as [Awesome](https://awesomewm.org/) or [XMonad](https://xmonad.org/). I find them more efficient at getting out of my way and putting an emphasis on what I really care about: The actual programs I run on my machine. *I have also been working on my own window manager, so who knows, maybe in the future I will be using only that.*

# Web Browser
My “normie” web browser of choice is [Ungoogled Chromium.](https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium) This is a fork of Google's Chromium, but with all Google spyware and bloat removed. You get the performance and wide support of Google Chrome, without any of the privacy concerns. I chose to use this web browser simply because it's the most "minimalist" of them all, not counting independent web browsers like [Suckless' Surf.](https://surf.suckless.org/)

A similar web browser is [LibreWolf;](https://librewolf.net/) essentially Firefox, but with all telemetry and Mozilla bloat removed. It also includes uBlock Origin, which to some people is a plus. Then there's also the [Brave Browser,](https://brave.com/) which blocks ads and shows you more "privacy respecting" ads to pay you in their crypto, BAT. I find it to be a bit bloated and not exactly my sorta thing, but I don't hate it or oppose people using it. Another browser I found out about recently that seemed really interesting was [qutebrowser;](https://qutebrowser.org/) you essentially have vim-like keybindings in a minimal browser.

**That's pretty much it for me. Most of my other recommendations of software will probably either be added here or written about in another article.**

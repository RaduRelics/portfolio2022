*Obligatory welcome post*

Hey! Thanks for checking out my blog. It's a work in progress, but I'm happy to have you here.

It is powered by Next.js and MDX, so I am able to use the Markdown syntax to write my blog posts and embed custom components such as this one:

```javascript:hello.js
const hello = 'Hello, world!'
var x = 6

if (x > 5)
    console.log(hello)
```

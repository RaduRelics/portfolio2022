Welcome to what's about to become my blog!

As you can see I can embed stylized code with Markdown and use custom components!

```javascript:hello.js
const hello = 'Hello, world!'
var x = 6

if (x > 5)
    console.log(hello)
```


I will be posting mainly about tech and I will teach others what I know on this blog. Until I post some real articles, these test posts will remain here as placeholders.
